This visualisation explores the age and caps of the countries competing in the FIFA World Cup 2018. 
The information is filterable by country and position and gives insight into longevity of national team players by country and position. 
Forward players are abbreviated by FW, midfielders by MF, defenders by DF and goalkeepers by GK. 
By hovering over the dots in the scatterplot the country of that dot pops up and the same country lights up in the bar chart on the left. 
By hovering over a country in the bar chart on the left, that chart lights up and information about total caps pops up. 
The bar chart on the right displays information about average caps or age for each position. 
It is possible to filter by country by selecting a country from the drop down list. 
To change the bar chart from caps to age or vice versa press the button Age or Caps.
